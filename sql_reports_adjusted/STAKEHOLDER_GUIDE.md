## üí° How the Data Works

### Data Sources

All metrics come from your production database:

| Table | What It Stores | Used For |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **players** | Player profiles & registration info | Registration metrics, filtering |
| **companies** | Brand/casino information | Brand filtering, currency defaults |
| **transactions** | All financial & gaming activity | Deposits, withdrawals, bets, wins, revenue |
| **affiliates** | Partner/affiliate details | Affiliate performance tracking |

### Currency Handling

**The Challenge:**
Players deposit in multiple currencies (EUR, USD, RON, etc.) but reports need one standard currency for comparison.

**The Solution: 4-Level Currency Resolution**

The system checks these sources in order:

1. **Transaction-specific currency** - Most accurate (transaction.metadata‚Üí'currency')
2. **Transaction default** - Second choice (transaction.cash_currency)
3. **Player wallet currency** - Third choice (players.wallet_currency)
4. **Company default** - Last resort (companies.currency)

All amounts are converted to **EUR** for reporting using real-time exchange rates.

**Why EUR:**
- Primary market currency
- Stable reference point
- Regulatory reporting standard

### Date & Time Handling

**Time Zone:** All times in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)

**Date Buckets:**
- **Daily reports:** One row per calendar day
- **Monthly reports:** One row per calendar month
- **Cohorts:** Grouped by first deposit month or registration month

**Default Periods:**
- Daily KPIs ‚Üí Last 31 days
- Monthly KPIs ‚Üí Last 12 months
- Cohort reports ‚Üí Last 12 months of cohorts

### What Makes a "Completed" Transaction

Only completed, valid transactions count in reports:

**Required:**
- `status = 'completed'` ‚úÖ
- `balance_type = 'withdrawable'` (for deposits/withdrawals/cash gaming)
- Correct category and type (e.g., deposit must be category='deposit' AND type='credit')

**Excluded:**
- Pending transactions ‚ùå
- Failed transactions ‚ùå
- Cancelled transactions ‚ùå
- Test account transactions ‚ùå (if filter applied)

## üìä Reading Cohort Reports

### What is a Cohort?

A **cohort** is a group of players who started at the same time (usually same month).

**Example:**
- **January 2025 Cohort** = All players who made first deposit in January 2025
- **Month 0** = January (their first month)
- **Month 1** = February (one month later)
- **Month 2** = March (two months later)

### Absolute vs. Percentage Cohort Reports

**Absolute Reports:**
- Show actual counts or amounts
- Example: "150 players still depositing in Month 3"

**Percentage Reports (%):**
- Show values as % of Month 0
- Example: "60% retention in Month 3" (if Month 0 had 250 players, Month 3 has 150)

**When to Use Each:**
- **Absolute:** Understanding raw numbers, planning capacity
- **Percentage:** Comparing cohorts of different sizes, identifying trends

### Reading the Retention Curve

**Good Retention Pattern:**
```
Month 0: 100%
Month 1: 40-60%
Month 2: 30-45%
Month 3: 25-35%
Month 6: 15-25%
Month 12: 10-20%
```

**Warning Signs:**
- Steep drop after Month 1 (>60% loss) ‚Üí Onboarding issues
- Continuous steep decline ‚Üí Engagement problems
- Month 3 < 20% ‚Üí Player experience issues

## üé® Visual Debugging Guide

### When Numbers Don't Look Right

**Metric seems too high:**
1. Check if test accounts are excluded
2. Verify date range is correct
3. Confirm currency filter is applied
4. Check if filtering for specific brand

**Metric seems too low:**
1. Check if too many filters are applied
2. Verify date range includes expected period
3. Check device filter (mobile vs desktop)
4. Confirm country filter isn't too restrictive

**Numbers don't match between reports:**
1. Compare date ranges (daily vs monthly periods)
2. Check currency filters match
3. Verify same player filters applied
4. Check if one report includes bonuses, other doesn't

**Cohort retention looks strange:**
1. Ensure cohort date range is appropriate
2. Check if enough time has passed (Month 12 needs 13 months of data)
3. Verify players in cohort had opportunity to transact
4. Compare absolute vs percentage views

## ‚ùì FAQ for Stakeholders

**Q: Why do Daily and Monthly totals sometimes differ?**
A: Different date bucketing. Daily counts exact dates; Monthly groups by calendar month. A player active on Jan 31 and Feb 1 = 2 days but could be 1 or 2 months depending on view.

**Q: What's the difference between GGR and Revenue?**
A: GGR = gaming profit before bonuses. Revenue = GGR minus bonus costs. Revenue is your true bottom line.

**Q: Why does LTV show EUR when player deposited USD?**
A: All amounts are converted to EUR for standardization. Original currency is tracked but converted for reporting.

**Q: Can I see data older than 12 months?**
A: Yes! Use the Start Date and End Date filters to set any date range. Default is 12 months for performance.

**Q: What if a player is in multiple cohorts?**
A: Players appear in only one cohort based on their FIRST deposit date. They're locked to that cohort forever.

**Q: How often should I review these reports?**
A:
- Daily KPIs: Every morning for operational health
- Monthly KPIs: Weekly for trend monitoring
- Cohort reports: Monthly for strategic planning

**Q: What's a "good" conversion rate?**
A: Depends on market, but generally:
- Organic traffic: 8-15%
- Affiliate traffic: 5-12%
- Premium markets (UK, Germany): 10-20%
- Emerging markets: 3-8%

**Q: Why do some cohort cells show blank/null?**
A: Not enough time has passed yet. Example: March 2025 cohort can't show Month 12 data in April 2025.
